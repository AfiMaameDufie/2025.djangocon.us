title: Get Active at DjangoCon US 2025

üö¥üèªüèÉüèæüèäüèΩüö∂üèº Looking to get active during DjangoCon US?

Having talks means a lot of time spent not moving while watching talks. It's important to take care of your body as well as your mind, and a good way to do that is to get moving.

If you would like a little social motivation (or an excuse to share your accomplishments), we've created a [Strava group](https://www.strava.com/clubs/dcus-2025) as we had in 2021-24. It's a different group from the last few years, so you'll have to join again even if you joined in previous years.

Once we send invitations to attendees to join the conference Slack instance (invitations will be sent out to ticket holders by Sunday, September 7), join the `#outings` channel if you'd like to join or plan a group exercise.

## At the hotel

The [voco Downtown](https://www.ihg.com/voco/hotels/us/en/chicago/chiwp/hoteldetail/amenities) has an indoor pool on the 16th floor. In addition, it has a 24-hour fitness center.

At the fitness center, you'll find:

- Exercise Bike(s)
- Free Weights
- Sauna
- Treadmill(s)
- Yoga Mats, Medicine Balls, Weight Bench, Water Station

Most of the hotels nearby have a fitness center, so make sure you check with your hotel if you're staying elsewhere.

## Walking/running/hiking/biking

The [Lakefront Trail](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/lakefront-trail) is an 18-mile long trail right along Lake Michigan that has excellent paved walking and cycling paths.

There are numerous Chicago Park District Parks nearby. To find some, go to the [Chicago Park District](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/park-finder/map) and start browsing. As a visual landmark, the hotel itself is adjacent to the fork in the river just above the big C in Chicago when you zoom out.

## Bicycling

There are numerous bike-friendly roads near the hotel in addition to the Lakeshore Trail from above. In addition, if you'd like to go on some longer treks, there are routes to Indiana ([GPX](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-indiana.gpx), [FIT](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-indiana.fit)) for those of you who want to check another box off your "states I've biked in" list, Northwestern University ([GPX](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-northwestern.gpx), [FIT](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-northwestern.fit)) if you want to go see the school's [temporary football stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Stadium_(Northwestern_University)), or a much shorter trek to Montrose Beach [GPX](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-montrose-beach.gpx), [FIT](/assets/gpx/dcus-25-hotel-to-montrose-beach.fit).

Disclaimer: these routes have not been tested in person yet. Use them at your own risk.

## Sightseeing

There are lots of landmarks to go visit in Chicago, including the [Cloud Gate](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_s_publicartcloudgateinmillenniumpark.html) (AKA the giant bean) in Millennium Park, the [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://www.lpzoo.org/) which is free to enter, and the numerous museums at [Grant Park](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/grant-ulysses-park), all of which are within a half hour transit ride or 15-minute bike ride from the hotel.

## Swimming

The city [beaches](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/facilities/beaches) will be closed to swimming for the season after Labor Day as there will be no lifeguards on duty.

You're probably best off with the [voco Downtown](https://www.ihg.com/voco/hotels/us/en/chicago/chiwp/hoteldetail/amenities) indoor pool on the 16th floor.

## We hope you enjoy your time while you are in Chicago and get a chance to get out and enjoy the area!
