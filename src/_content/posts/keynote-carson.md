### We're honored to announce our first keynote speaker for DjangoCon US 2025: Carson Gross

We had the opportunity to sit down with Carson and ask him a few questions about his work, his upcoming talk, and what he's looking forward to at DjangoCon US 2025.

## How do you use Django?

> I do not use Django very often because my main profession is as a teacher and we mainly use Java here. However, the Django community has embraced HTMX, a web library that I created, and so I have a lot of friends in the community.

## Can you give us a teaser about what your talk is about?

> I will be speaking about the philosophy of Nintendo Game Designer Gunpei Yokoi who created the original Game Boy.  His philosophy translates as "Lateral Thinking with Withered (or Seasoned) Technology" and I am going to apply that thinking to web development, particularly the combination of HTMX & Django.

## What are you most looking forward to at DjangoCon US 2025?

> I am looking forward to meeting people and talking about hypermedia.

## What are your favourite topics at conferences?

> I enjoy technical deep dives in particular, especially when they start from first (or simple) principles.

## How do you view the connections made at conferences?

> I love making connections, but I am pretty remote living in Montana so they tend to be relatively short lived unfortunately.

## Can you tell us about your career journey?

> I went to college thinking I would be a computer programmer, since I enjoyed it in school.  I dropped out of CS due to being overwhelmed in the program I was in.  I ended up getting a job as a programmer anyway because that was what people were hiring for at the time.  I eventually went back to grad school and finished getting a masters in computer science.
>
> After that I worked in the Bay Area in a traditional software company for about a decade, then moved on to found a small company.  I eventually had to sell that company due to partner disagreements and decided to move to Montana and try teaching at Montana State.  Over my working career I also created a few open source projects, the most famous of which is HTMX.

## How did you approach your career growth?

> To be honest it has been pretty chaotic, with many moments that seemed hopeless.

## When did you start speaking at conferences, and what has your experience been like so far?

> I have been speaking at conferences in 2016, when I gave a talk on ``` intercooler.js ```, the predecessor to HTMX.  It was to an almost empty room.  It's gotten better since then.

## What do you like to do outside of your typical workday?

> I like skiing, fishing & hiking with my family.

## How do you see Django evolving over the next few years, and what excites you most about its future?

> I'm excited to see how HTMX & Django can continue to drive forward the notion of hypermedia-oriented web applications.

## What advice would you offer to attendees who wish to contribute to Django or its ecosystem after the conference?

> Unfortunately I can't really offer anything specific on this one, other than just trying to do good work & be nice to people.

## Are you ok with people asking you more later?

> Of course.
