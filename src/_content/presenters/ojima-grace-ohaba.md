Ojima Grace Ohaba is a Django backend developer at a financial management startup, where she combines her technical expertise with a passion for building inclusive and impactful solutions. With a background in law as a barrister and solicitor, Ojima made a bold transition into tech, driven by her curiosity and determination to break barriers in a male-dominated industry.

Her journey into software development began with self-learning, followed by earning a diploma in software engineering from AltSchool Africa. Along the way, she faced challenges such as unconscious bias and workplace discrimination, but her resilience and the support of her peers kept her moving forward. Today, Ojima is not only a skilled developer but also an advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech, using her story to inspire others who are transitioning from non-traditional backgrounds.

A proud Nigerian, Ojima draws strength from her culture—its vibrant community, rich traditions, and the resilience of women who defy societal expectations. When she’s not coding, she enjoys exploring Nigerian cuisine, which she describes as her “source of life and energy.”

Ojima is passionate about creating spaces where underrepresented groups feel valued and supported. Through her work and advocacy, she hopes to empower more women and minorities to pursue careers in tech and to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable industry.
