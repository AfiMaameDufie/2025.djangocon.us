My education is in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I have worked for 17 years for various federally funded research centers. First at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab building simulation frameworks used by prime aerospace contractors to prove out their systems in software. For the last 10 years I have been doing contract work for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory mostly in the area of satellite navigation and occasionally for long range space missions.

I have broad experience in computer science but web development always intimidated me. There's just too much going on! Too many standards to know about and too many security pitfalls! Also there's the whole JavaScript of it all! When I found Django everything finally made sense! Then I found the Django community and it felt like home :)
