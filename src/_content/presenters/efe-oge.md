I'm a software developer currently living in the Netherlands. I specialize in building and deploying web applications, ensuring the delivery of high-quality, scalable and maintainable software products with 'boring technology'. I mainly develop with Python & Javascript. I'm a co-organizer of PyIstanbul and PyCon Turkey.
