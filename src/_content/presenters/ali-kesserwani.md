My name is Ali Kesserwani, and I am a PhD student in Anthropology at Emory University and a masterâ€™s student in HCI/Interactive Intelligence at Georgia Tech.

I graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 2024 after completing a double major in Computer Science and Anthropology with a minor in Ancient and Medieval Studies. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on combining computational methods and software development with archaeology and linguistics. I also researched in ancient languages (Aramaic, Arabic, Phoenician).

As a graduate student, my interests lie in applying computational, statistical, and machine learning methods to the humanities, particularly in areas like historical linguistics and archaeology, as well as in population biology and genetics, with a focus on ancient DNA research.

I am currently the founder and developer of LinguaBerry, an all-in-one language learning app that seamlessly integrates reading, writing, and memorization into an engaging and interactive language learning experience.
