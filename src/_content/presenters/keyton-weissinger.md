I am a thirty-year technologist and entrepreneur with a focus on Django and, more recently, LLM-based artificial intelligence application development.

I’ve worked with Django since pre-1.0 including past projects: a Montessori school management system and a content management system for healthcare content currently in use throughout the US at all VA and DoD facilities.

More recently, I am co-founder and CTO of Copient.ai, a AI-powered, conversational learning platform in use at 30+ of the leading business schools across the country and many of the top pharmaceutical companies.

I am a best-selling author and technical editor for O’Reilly and Associates and patent holder.
