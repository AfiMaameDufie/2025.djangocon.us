In addition to my experience as a software developer, I've also had a strong background in the field of Information Security.

In 1999 I was selected to be part of the Enterprise Architecture Committee. My role in the committee was to identify the key security principles to be applied to the environment at the corporate level. In 2002, I was assigned as the Divisional Information Security Officer, working to enhance our division's security processes - a role I held until 2006. I remained a member of the Enterprise Architecture Council until I left that role in 2014.

Since that time, my training and experience with security-related topics continues to be a significant part of my professional career.
