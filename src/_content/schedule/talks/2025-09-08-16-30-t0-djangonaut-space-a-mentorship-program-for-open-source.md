Djangonaut Space is a mentorship program created to address the problem of sustainability for open source projects. It helps grow the community and bridge the gap between new contributors and long-time maintainers, ensuring the web framework and its eco-system continues to thrive and adapt to changing needs.

I will share my experiences and insights about Djangonaut Space as a new contributor and session organizer. Whether youâ€™re new to open source, or a long-time maintainer, or a community leader, a mentorship program can have many benefits for your community. Learn how you can get involved, or how you might borrow ideas to create a successful mentorship program for your community.
