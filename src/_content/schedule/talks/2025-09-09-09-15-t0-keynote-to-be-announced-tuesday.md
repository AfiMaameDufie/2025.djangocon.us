title: "Keynote: All The Ways To Use Django"
track: t0
---
Ever thought "I love Django but I can't use it on this project because [REASON]"?  Let's take a second look.  Django has lots of parts, and it can still do a lot even if you don't use all of them.

We're going to take Django apart and look at its pieces.  In the process, we'll look at new ways to use Django that you may have discarded as infeasible, including the following:

* When you have a lot of background and asynchronous tasks
* When you are using JavaScript frameworks for your frontend
* When you have a multi-service backend
* When you are using a database other than PostgreSQL or MySQL
* When you have no database
* When you aren't building a website
* When you have a lot of existing software not built in Django

Throughout this talk, we'll look at how to use Django an appropriate amount for each situation, how Django can still be powerful even if you only use a few pieces of the framework, and things that could be added to Django for it to better address some of these use-cases.
