In 1729, Jonathan Swift presented an elegant and well thought-out solution to the problem of homelessness and poverty plaguing Ireland. He argued that his solution would result in a much more productive and fulfilling society. While not many could digest the meat of his proposal, it was still effective in exposing a widening gap of social inequality and abuse. 

Is it possible that Swift's proposal can be applied within our technosphere? Did he provide us with a recipe for success, or at least little nuggets of wisdom to chew on? 

Many attending this conference may be keenly aware of the dichotomy between open source and big tech. There is a relationship that always seems to be at risk of imploding. Should we be encouraging new (and existing) engineers to participate in open source, in spite of this tenuous relationship? If this topic whets your appetite, you'll definitely want to come to see what's cooking.
