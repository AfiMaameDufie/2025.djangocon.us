This talk will show attendees how to streamline the day two operations of delivering and maintaining Python applications in production environments. It emphasizes GitOps principles, repeatable CI/CD workflows, and cloud-agnostic deployment using Kubernetes and Argo CD.

Deploying code shouldn’t be stressful. But too often, the journey from local dev to production is fragile, manual, and hard to debug. This talk is about building peace of mind into your pipeline — with GitOps, Kubernetes, and open source tools like Argo CD that make continuous delivery predictable, repeatable, and scalable from the very first release to the 50th.

We’ll tackle the realities of “day two” DevOps — what happens after the first deploy. From managing rollbacks and coordinating releases to enforcing consistency across dev, staging, and production, you’ll learn how to bring stability and scalability to your delivery pipeline.

In a live demo, we’ll deploy a full stack Django app from GitHub to production using Argo CD and GitHub Actions — with observability, rollback strategies, and environment parity built in from the start.

**You’ll learn how to:**

- Set up a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline that works across all environments
- Automate rollouts, rollbacks, and version control of infrastructure
- Understand why Kubernetes is a future-proof platform for Django teams
- Gain confidence in releasing updates safely, consistently, and at scale
- Leverage open source tools to eliminate manual deployment headaches

Whether you're writing the code or leading the team, you'll leave with a clear, practical blueprint for shipping faster — and with fewer surprises.
