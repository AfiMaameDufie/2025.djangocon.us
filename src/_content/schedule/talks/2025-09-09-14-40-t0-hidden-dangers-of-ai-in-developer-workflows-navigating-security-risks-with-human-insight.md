title: 'Hidden Dangers Of AI In Developer Workflows: Navigating Security Risks with Human Insight'
track: t0
---

AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot have become indispensable in developers' daily workflows. Whether it is for code samples and scaffolding, prototyping, or documentation, AI can help eliminate a lot of toil from the developer's day-to-day. 

The hidden dangers that AI have introduced that are worth exploring.

This presentation will look at the critical security challenges associated with AI-enhanced development workflows and the essential role of human oversight in mitigating these risks. 

We'll look into three major areas of concern:
1. The AI told me to do it that way…
2. Hallucinations everywhere
3. Where did my data go?

Join this talk to see some real examples of AI getting it wrong, but stay for a discussion on how you can leverage already existing tools to make the best use of the most valuable resource in the company…your team's time. Expect to leave with a fresh perspective on how bright a future we can build as people fostering more secure and efficient development practices.
