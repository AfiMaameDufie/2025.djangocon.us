In light of ongoing health considerations, this year the DjangoCon US Public Health Policy highly encourages all attendees to wear masks throughout the conference spaces where distancing cannot be maintained and expect voluntary testing by attendees.

We expect that all attendees respect those who choose to wear a mask and their boundaries.

DjangoCon US also encourages attendees to take a COVID test prior to arriving at the converence.. We ask that people test again before sprints begin on Thursday. We strongly recommend that people wear a mask and have the latest vaccination boosters. If you are not familiar, we suggest you check out the [CDC's Travel guidelines to stay safe](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/covid19).

The conference will feature select areas in the talk rooms where attendees will be required to wear masks. These areas will be some distance (but not separated by walls) from non-masked areas to allow diffusion.

The conference will provide [N95 masks](https://www.stauffersafety.com/Product/3m-9205-bulk-3m-aura-n95-particulate-respirator-mask-701199) for people to wear. We recommend that all attendees wear a certified KN95 / N95 respirator mask (with no outflow vent) while inside. If you prefer to wear a surgical mask, we recommend an ASTM Level 3 rated mask.

<!--If you prefer to purchase your own PPE, DjangoCon US is offering up to a $50 reimbursement. This should be for higher filtration PPE you acquire yourself (i.e. reusable respirators, etc). Please [email us](mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}) before the conference to coordinate.-->

DjangoCon US reserves the right to increase the requirements of this policy based on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or positive test rates as reported by the CDC or other authorities. We may also be required to alter our policy to conform with local, state, or federal mandates.
