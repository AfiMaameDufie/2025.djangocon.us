## Proposing to DjangoCon US

### Selection process

We'll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees. Volunteers from the Django community are invited to help us pick talks, and we rely heavily on them to help us select interesting and beneficial ones for our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and collectively decide which ones to accept.

### Talks (September 8th, 9th, & 10th)

Length: 25 minutes or 45 minutes

We are looking for original and exciting talks that can benefit the diverse interests of our audience. Don't feel boxed into Django-centric themes; we also love talks about community, web development, user experience, etc. If you're a first-timer - don't fret! We would love to be remembered as the conference where you started your speaking career.

Here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last couple of years:

*   [DjangoCon US 2024 Talks](https://2024.djangocon.us/schedule/)
*   [DjangoCon US 2023 Talks](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/)
*   [DjangoCon US 2022 Talks](https://2022.djangocon.us/talks/)
*   [DjangoCon US 2021 Talks](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/)
*   [DjangoCon US 2019 Talks](https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/)


### Deep Dive Talks (September 10th)

This year, we will be curating a deep dive day to focus on exploring Django and Django-adjacent topics in detail. Deep dive day is meant to follow in the footsteps of [Django Under the Hood](https://djangounderthehood.com/) and will provide a range of topics presented in-depth, targeting varying levels of Django experience. Talks of this nature will mix community submissions and personal invitations. If you believe your talk is a good fit, please indicate so on your submission to our CFP by choosing the “deep dive” tag!

### Lightning Talks (September 8th, 9th, & 10th)

Not up for a full-on talk or tutorial? Looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are talks under 5 minutes with or without slides on almost any topic you want! Even if you're nervous or shy, remember: it's a **maximum** of 5 minutes. Sign-ups will happen at the conference.

### Speaker Travel Assistance

As we have in the past, this year, we have set aside up to $500 per speaker to help offset the cost of travel to the conference. In order to maximize the amount we can provide, we ask that speakers who will be reimbursed by their employer decline the assistance offered so it can be spread out among speakers who do not receive travel reimbursement. Receipts for travel expenses will be required.

## Pre-conference information

You will have the option to upload a rough transcript of your talk approximately two weeks before the conference to give the captioning team a chance to train on any jargon you might use in your talk. This is by no means required but it will provide a more accessible experience to your audience.

The organizing team reserves the right to request a review of draft slides at any point up to the start of the conference for any reason including but not limited to content, messaging quality, and more. Failure to provide these slides in a timely manner may result in your removal from the program. We understand that the slides are draft quality and will not be shared outside the program and code of conduct teams.
